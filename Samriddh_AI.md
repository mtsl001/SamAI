Scenario 2: Debugging \& Issue Resolution
User Flow: "Fix Authentication Error in Existing Project"
Step 1: Error Report
text
User uploads error logs and describes issue:
"Users can't log in. Getting '422 Unprocessable Entity' error.
Here are the error logs and my authentication code."

[Uploads: auth_service.py, login_component.tsx, error.log]

Step 2: Automated Error Analysis
text
🔍 ANALYZING AUTHENTICATION ERROR...

📊 Error Pattern Recognition:
🔴 HTTP 422: Validation Error Detected
🔍 Location: FastAPI authentication endpoint
⚠️ Root Cause: Pydantic model validation failure

📁 Affected Files Analysis:

- backend/app/auth/models.py (validation schema)
- backend/app/auth/routes.py (login endpoint)
- frontend/src/services/auth.ts (API call format)

🧠 Context Understanding:

- JWT implementation using python-jose
- Frontend sending email/password in request body
- Backend expecting specific field names and formats

Step 3: Root Cause Identification
text
🎯 ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS COMPLETE

💡 Primary Issue:
Frontend is sending field "email" but backend Pydantic model
expects "username" field for login validation.

🔗 Related Issues Found:

1. Password validation regex too strict (blocking valid passwords)
2. Missing error handling for network failures
3. JWT token expiry not handled gracefully

📈 Impact Assessment:

- Affects: 100% of login attempts
- Severity: Critical (blocks all user access)
- Fix Complexity: Low (field name alignment + validation update)

Step 4: Solution Proposals
text
🛠️ SOLUTION OPTIONS

✅ Option 1: Update Frontend (Recommended)
Pros: Maintains backend consistency, minimal backend changes
Cons: May affect other frontend code
Effort: 15 minutes

Changes needed:

- Update auth.ts to send "username" instead of "email"
- Update login form validation
- Test login flow

✅ Option 2: Update Backend
Pros: Maintains frontend consistency
Cons: May break API contracts with other clients
Effort: 20 minutes

Changes needed:

- Update Pydantic model to use "email" field
- Update authentication logic
- Update API documentation

✅ Option 3: Support Both Fields (Most Flexible)
Pros: Backward compatible, handles both cases
Cons: Slightly more complex validation logic
Effort: 25 minutes

Step 5: User Selection \& Implementation
text
User: "Go with Option 3 - support both fields for flexibility"

🚀 IMPLEMENTING COMPREHENSIVE FIX...

🔧 Code Changes:

Generated Fix Code:
python

# backend/app/auth/models.py

from pydantic import BaseModel, validator
from typing import Union

class LoginRequest(BaseModel):
username: Union[str, None] = None
email: Union[str, None] = None
password: str

    @validator('email', 'username', pre=True, always=True)
    def validate_user_identifier(cls, v, values):
        username = values.get('username')
        email = values.get('email')
        
        if not username and not email:
            raise ValueError('Either username or email must be provided')
        
        return v
    
# backend/app/auth/services.py

def authenticate_user(login_data: LoginRequest):
identifier = login_data.email or login_data.username

Step 6: Testing Strategy Migration
text
🧪 ADAPTED TESTING PATTERNS

✅ Migrated Test Patterns:

- Factory pattern for test data (enhanced for e-commerce entities)
- Mock external services (Stripe, shipping APIs)
- Integration test database setup
- API endpoint testing framework

✅ New E-commerce Test Scenarios:

- Order processing workflows
- Payment processing edge cases
- Inventory management scenarios
- Multi-vendor commission calculations


# Example adapted test

class TestOrderProcessing:
async def test_complete_order_flow(self):
\# Using adapted factory pattern from blog
user = await UserFactory.create(role=UserRole.CUSTOMER)
product = await ProductFactory.create(price=29.99)

        # Test complete flow
        cart = await self.add_to_cart(user, product)
        order = await self.create_order(user, cart)
        payment = await self.process_payment(order)
        
        assert order.status == OrderStatus.PAID
        assert payment.status == PaymentStatus.SUCCEEDED
